# PISA2012
Overview: This is a Udacity project about communicating findings. This project consists of two parts: Data analysis and data visualization techniques. NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries were used. 

Data Set: PISA 2012 data set was used in this project. PISA is a global survey that explores how well prepared 15-year-old students for life after school. Students from 65 countries responded to the survey in 2012.

Data Exploration: The data consisted of 636 columns and 485490 rows. After examining the data set using the PISA data dictionary, country, gender, and mother education level were selected from the data set as independent variables, and math, science, and reading scores were chosen as dependent variables.

Findings: Male students' math and science mean scores are higher than female students' math and science mean scores. However, there is no significant difference between male and female students' reading mean scores. Students whose mother education level is 3A have higher math, science, and reading mean scores than the other students. Students who live in China have higher math, science, and reading mean scores than those who live in other countries. Additionally, there is a high correlation between science and math (r=0.9) and science and reading (r=0.88), and math and reading (r=0.86).
